"I have had the pleasure of diving into multiple exciting roles in my career, from facilitating learning and development as a trainer, to expressing my creativity as a graphic designer, and to providing Desktop support for HP. However, I've always had a natural curiosity and passion for coding, and now I'm finally ready to dive headfirst into the world of code development with enthusiasm and eagerness for what lies ahead!"
