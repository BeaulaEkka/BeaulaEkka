"I have had the pleasure of diving into multiple exciting roles in my career, from facilitating Learning and Development as a corporate Trainer, to expressing my creativity as a Graphic Designer, and to providing Desktop & IT Support. However, I've always had a natural curiosity and passion for coding, and now I'm finally ready to dive headfirst into the world of code development with enthusiasm and eagerness for what lies ahead!"
